# VQ-VAE based SINR compression and LSTM prediction 
In this repository, we are going to explore the schemes of VQ-VAE based SINR compression and LSTM based Prediction

## VQ-VAE Models
VQ-VAE models trainig files can be found in the folder "compress_recover"
Models are saved in the folder "models_new"

## LSTM model
LSTM training files are in the folder "Interferncer_prediction"

## Simulation
Simulations files saved in the folder "compare_recover".

## Others
Others update are also inclucded.
