# VQ-VAE based SINR compression and LSTM prediction 
Welcome to the repository dedicated to VQ-VAE based SINR Compression and LSTM Prediction. Here, we present a focused exploration of these advanced schemes, aimed at efficient data compression and accurate SINR forecasting.

## VQ-VAE Models
Explore the compress_recover folder to access crucial files for training our VQ-VAE models. These models are designed to compress Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) data using Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders. Saved models reside in the models_new directory, ready for deployment in diverse applications.

## LSTM model
The Interferncer_prediction folder contains essential LSTM training files. Long Short-Term Memory networks serve as the foundation for our SINR prediction model, offering sophisticated sequential modeling for precise forecasting.

## Simulation
In the compare_recover folder, discover simulation files showcasing the effectiveness of our methodologies. Witness how our VQ-VAE based SINR compression and LSTM prediction techniques deliver reduced data sizes without sacrificing predictive accuracy.
