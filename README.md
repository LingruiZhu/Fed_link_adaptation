# Link Adaptation codes
In this repository, we are going to explore the schemes of VQ-VAE based SINR compression and LSTM based Prediction

# VQ-VAE Models
VQ-VAE models trainig files can be found in the folder "compress_recover"
Models are saved in the folder "models_new"

# Simulation
Simulations files saved in the folder "compare_recover".
